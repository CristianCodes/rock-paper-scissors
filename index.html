    <p>
        Your game is going to play against the computer, so begin with a function called getComputerChoice that will randomly return either ‘Rock’, ‘Paper’ or ‘Scissors’. We’ll use this function in the game to make the computer’s play. Tip: use the console to make sure this is returning the expected output before moving to the next step!

        Write a function that plays a single round of Rock Paper Scissors. The function should take two parameters - the playerSelection and computerSelection - and then return a string that declares the winner of the round like so: "You Lose! Paper beats Rock"
